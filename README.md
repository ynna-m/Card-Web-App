# Card-Web-App
Tarot Cards
Website right here:
https://major-tarot-cards.000webhostapp.com/

Made this website specifically for people who want to use their own card images, or other people's card artworks to play with, and for artists, who wants to play with their self-drawn cards. Since most artists typically only draw the Major Arcana ones, I started with the Major Arcana first.

As for including Minor Arcana, I might do it in later updates.

Used both localStorage and IndexedDB for caching data, with the latter used for caching images.

This also uses the old PWA code from Google to make the app available offline, as well as allow the app to be installable in mobile devices, and for people using Chromium-based browsers.
